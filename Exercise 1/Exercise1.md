# Exercise 1 - Dart Basics
This exercise is expected you to get yourself familiarize with very basics of Dart Programming Language. These exercises assume you already have setup your environment for working with Dart.

## Instructions
* You are required to setup the environment that you are planning to use this term for this course
* You can also use online compilers if you want, however, installing IDEs on your local machine gives you more freedom and control
* You can work on multiple IDEs as well to get a feel of how they work. This would give you a choice of using among various IDEs.
* This exercise is for your practice, no need to submit it for marking.

## Questions
1.	Use any loop in Dart to show a mathematical table for 5 starting from 1 to 10, e.g., `5 * 1 = 5, 5 * 2 = 10` etc.
2.	Take a list of numbers in Dart and show all the elements of the list that are less than 10.
3.	Take two lists and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between them (without duplicates).
4.	Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not.
5.	Ask the user for a string and checks to see if the string contains all the vowels or not.
6.	Generate a random number between 1 and 100. Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right.
7.	Write a Dart program that returns first 10 Fibonacci numbers. Use functions to solve this problem.
8.	Write a Dart program that takes a string from user and returns reverse of that string.
9.	Take a `Map` in Dart that contains Fruits along with their quantity. Use `foreach` or an `anonymous function` to display all the elements of the map along with their values, e.g., `There are 4 apples` etc.
10.	Use an anonymous function to return first 10 Fibonacci numbers.
